# codeq.me

A hosted version of [codeq](https://github.com/Datomic/codeq) for GitHub-based Clojure projects.

See [Project Overview](docs/project_overview.md) for more information.

## Getting Started

1. Start the application: `lein run-dev` \*
2. Go to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) to see: `Hello World!`
3. Read your app's source code at src/me/codeq/website/service.clj. Explore the docs of functions
   that define routes and responses.
4. Run your app's tests with `lein test`. Read the tests at test/me/codeq/website/service_test.clj.
5. Learn more! See the [Links section below](#links).

\* `lein run-dev` automatically detects code changes. Alternatively, you can run in production mode
with `lein run`.

## Configuration

To configure logging see config/logback.xml. By default, the app logs to stdout and logs/.
To learn more about configuring Logback, read its [documentation](http://logback.qos.ch/documentation.html).
