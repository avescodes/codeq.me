Project Overview: codeq.me
==============================

Background
-----------

**Why was this project proposed?**

codeq.me is an attempt to sharpen my skills in Clojure's web-facing stack, using tools like Datomic, ClojureScript, Om and Pedestal-service.

**What business need/challenge are we solving?**

The desire to sharpen skills like:

* Systems design
* General Development in Clojure
* UI/UX
* DevOps

The system itself is codeq-as-a-service. 

**What are the pain points today?**

*On skills*: A general lack of familiarity with the tools, both incumbents and newcomers. Time away from frontend development has left previous skills there dull.

*On codeq*: The Codeq tool can be difficult to setup, requiring active installions of both codeq and Datomic, along with enough knowledge of Datomic and Codeq's schema to query it for any useful insights.

**What auxiliary goals/opportunities are we trying to accomplish or achieve?**

* Add another project to my portfoilio
* Provide value to those in the community
* Fodder for blog post

**How long is the solution expected to last?**

This project should freshen me up for the next 3-6 months, paving the way for larger, more complicated systems.

The tool itself should have a low enough maintenance overhead and cost to be run indefinitely.

**What constraints currently exist for the project?**

Primarily time.

Project statement
------------------

```
The (name of team) will
(build, develop, design, implement, etc.)
a (what) for (whom)
```

**The `Ryan` will design and implement a hosted version of Codeq with a number of built-in widgets for gaining insight about public GitHub repository.**


### Completion

This project will be be considered **successfully** completed when there is a hosted Codeq service that can import and analyze Clojure repositories from GitHub, with two widgets: one that exposes the tree of *symbols* in the project, and another that exposes the history of a *symbol* across *commits*.

#### Quality attribute ranking

Usability > Reliability > Scalability

#### Scenarios // thresholds

* Usability
    * An authorized user should be able to add a new project in two clicks.
    * Users should be able to clearly understand where their new project is in the analysis pipeline. (Visibility of system status)
    * New analyzed contents should populate on a user's screen automatically.
    * (Aesthetic and minimalist design)
* Reliability
    * Failure of the codeq processing service should not alter the functioning of the web application and be accurately reported
* Scalability
    * Long-running or hung analyses should not affect the ability to conitnue analyzing other projects
    * In the event of high-load, the system should be able to increase processing power.

### Known risks and areas of unknown risks

* Multi-tenant codeq may be challenging.
* Integration with GitHub OAuth
* Codeq is an external tool that can take minutes to operate and may fail.
* Pedestal/Cljs/om is slightly new ground to break
* Very little experience implementing distributed systems


Metrics
-------

Metrics help us understand the project's context and progress.  They aid in
recognizing and identifying when project-wide problems occur.  Metrics provide
a baseline of objective data for making informed project-oriented decisions.

### Project metrics

 * Iteration burn up - points dev-completed within an iteration
 * Project burn down - total points remaining for the project (delivered to production)
 * Running tested features - cards or points delivered to production (not including defects or tasks)

### Software metrics

* Doc:code ratio
* Total source lines
* Cyclomatic complexity?
* Code coverage


### System metrics

* Latency to pick up new analyses
* Error rate of analyses
* Throughput of analyses

Extra
-----

### Special Conditions

 * Open source
    * No license restrictions, ideally project will be open sourced.
 * Additional technology restrictions?
     * Datomic
     * Om
     * Clojure/ClojureScript
     * Pedestal-service


### Baseline top-down estimations

Use [COCOMO with Monte Carlo simulation](http://csse.usc.edu/tools/COCOMO.php) to get an idea of where the project might end up.

*The entire project is [estimated](COCOMO.pdf) to be about **2.4 person-months** of effort*

### Baseline bottom-up estimations

Break down all major milestones into their individual tasks, and estimate effort (person-months) based on historical data

*In total, the project is estimated at **157 story points** of effort. At *4 points/day*, this is roughly **40 person-days** or **8 person-weeks**. This is similar to the top-down estimate of 2.4 person-months.*
